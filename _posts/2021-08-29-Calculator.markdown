Well this one was the last of the basics. After learning all the basic structures of javascript this one put us to the test. I have to admit that this was a lot. I spent long nights trying to figure this one out.

In the end I found that youtube has lots of videos with tutorials to help walk me through these. 

I followed one which helped tremendiously. The only issue is after completing it I realized that I had my hand held the whole time. This one I will have to come back to and prove myself again.

I have to say it is a really nice one. But maybe a little too nice for where I'm at right now.
