So here it is, the start. The biggest and hardest part. I started with `freecampcode`.org and got the juices flowing. Figured out that code was the most important part. Ran through and learning everything in there leassons thinking that would be the hard part. WRONG.

I started trying to do things on my own and realized I had no idea what I was doing. That is when I started `The Odin Project`. I started witht he basics. My first project was Google Home Page. I have it linked to my github account so you can preview it:
[Google Home Page](https://snaszy.github.io/google-homepage/){:target="_blank"}

This is just a static page that is duplicating the look of Google's homepage. No interactivity but maybe later for that.

You can see more of my projects on my github account under the username [Snaszy][snaszy-github].
