After doing the Google webpage it seemed like I was on my way. That wasnt too bad I told myself. Lets play with come code. This was the first real test. The nice part was that I was displaying the results in the console.

I sent the results off to my friends. The biggest complaint... It doesnt work. Even though the title said `Results in the console.log`. As Randy put it, this would be my first experience with user feedback.

Luckily further on we got to update the display and make it fully functioning. I have the final version available to view:

[Rock Paper Scissors](https://snaszy.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/){:target="_blank"}

![Google Home Page](/the-four-color-word/assets/rockpaperscissors.png){: width="200" }

The game will let you know who won each round and after 5 rounds will tell you who won over all. Still needs a reset button but refresh will work for now.

You can see more of my projects on my github account under the username [Snaszy][snaszy-github].
